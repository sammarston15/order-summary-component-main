## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Crash Course 2022 - Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/0xMQfnTU6oo?t=1383) - This helped me understand how `grid-template-areas` works for more complex layouts but with visual mapping of the layout when writing the code.
